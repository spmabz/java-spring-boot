## Practical

Your task is to build a RESTful Pet Store API, which must fulfill the requirements listed below. The three resources that need to be modeled are the pets, the store, and the users.

Use your best judgment.

The api must be able to:

- add a new pet to the Store.
- update an existing pet, both with complete and with - partial data.
- find a pet by id.
- find pets by a status.
- upload an image for the pet.
- return an aggregated list of the number of pets per - status.
- place an order for a pet.
- cancel an order for a pet.
- find an order by its id.
- create a user
- find a user by user name
- delete a user
- update a user
- let a user log in
- let a user log out
